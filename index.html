      <p>
        The aim of this game is to move through the maze collecting as much
        wealth as possible before you exit. You can gain wealth by defeating
        monsters you meet and taking their treasure. You can also choose to
        leave treasure in a room to mark that you've been there, but be aware
        you won't be able to pick this treasure up again once you've done so.
